# discord-mobile-data-terminal
A Discord MDT, allowing other users to search information on other users.

How does it work?

The program can be edited by heading to the main file further in the program in DiscordMDT/ which completely runs on it's own.
The GUI version is currently dysfunctional, and hence does not have a corresponding .jar file. 
The .jar file can be ran an executed with java in order to process it and search up any user.
GUI-beta and console-beta can be used to see what is currently in dev yet not completed.

**Current Issues:**
I'll edit that later.
